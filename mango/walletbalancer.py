# # ðŸ¥­ WalletBalancer
#
# This notebook deals with balancing a wallet after processing liquidations, so that it has
# appropriate funds for the next liquidation.
#
# We want to be able to maintain liquidity in our wallet. For instance if there are a lot of
# ETH shorts being liquidated, we'll need to supply ETH, but what do we do when we run out
# of ETH and there are still liquidations to perform?
#
# We 'balance' our wallet tokens, buying or selling or swapping them as required.
#

# # ðŸ¥­ Target Balances
#
# To be able to maintain the right balance of tokens, we need to know what the right
# balance is. Different people have different opinions, and we don't all have the same
# value in our liquidator accounts, so we need a way to allow whoever is running the
# liquidator to specify what the target token balances should be.
#
# There are two possible approaches to specifying the target value:
# * A 'fixed' value, like 10 ETH
# * A 'percentage' value, like 20% ETH
#
# Percentage is trickier, because to come up with the actual target we need to take into
# account the wallet value and the current price of the target token.
#
# The way this all hangs together is:
# * A parser parses string values (probably from a command-line) into `TargetBalance`
#   objects.
# * There are two types of `TargetBalance` objects - `FixedTargetBalance` and
#   `PercentageTargetBalance`.
# * To get the actual `TokenValue` for balancing, the `TargetBalance` must be 'resolved'
#   by calling `resolve()` with the appropriate token price and wallet value.
#

# # ðŸ¥­ TargetBalance class
#
# This is the abstract base class for our target balances, to allow them to be treated polymorphically.
#

#

# balance.
