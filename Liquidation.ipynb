    "\n",
    "The liquidation process involves paying off some or all of one of the liabilities in the under-collateralised margin account. Margin accounts can have liabilities in multiple tokens, but liquidation can only be performed on one token at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the basic steps to liquidate an account:\n",
    "1. (Optional) Force cancellation of all outstanding orders for the margin account in that market.\n",
    "2. Build and send the `PartialLiquidate` instruction.\n",
    "3. Repeat step 2 (if necessary) with fresh tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1 is optional. Open orders can lock funds in an account, preventing liquidation, but it may be desirable for liquidators to optimise their liquidation process by only force-cancelling orders on that margin account's first partial-liquidation. The margin account is unlikely to have been able to open new orders between partial-liquidations if they happen quickly enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "To actually run a liquidator, however, there are probably some additional steps:\n",
    "1. Find all liquidatable margin accounts.\n",
    "2. Pick the most appropriate of these margin accounts, based on that account's collatoralisation and the liquidator's token balances.\n",
    "3. Pick the market with the most value in the margin account's openorders accounts.\n",
    "4. Force cancellation of all outstanding orders for the margin account in that market.\n",
    "5. Build and send the `PartialLiquidate` instruction.\n",
    "6. Convert the received tokens to your desired tokens.\n",
    "7. Repeat from step 2 (if necessary) with fresh tokens.\n",
