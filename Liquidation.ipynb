    "If a new trade would mean your assets would be worth less 120% of the libilities - that your collateralisation ratio would be less than 120% - you will not be allowed to place the trade. No existing trades are closed, you just can't place any new orders.\n",

    "## Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The liquidation process involves paying off some or all of one of the liabilities in the under-collateralised margin account. Margin accounts can have liabilities in multiple tokens, but liquidation can only be performed on one token at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the basic steps to liquidate an account:\n",
    "1. Force cancellation of all outstanding orders for the margin account in that market.\n",
    "2. Build and send the `PartialLiquidate` instruction.\n",
    "3. Repeat step 2 (if necessary) with fresh tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "But to actually run a liquidator, there are probably some additional steps:\n",
    "1. Find all liquidatable margin accounts.\n",
    "2. Pick the most appropriate of these margin accounts, based on that account's collatoralisation and the liquidator's token balances.\n",
    "3. Pick the market with the most value in the margin account's openorders accounts.\n",
    "4. Force cancellation of all outstanding orders for the margin account in that market.\n",
    "5. Pick the market with the highest borrows and lowest deposits for the account being liquidated.\n",
    "6. Build and send the `PartialLiquidate` instruction.\n",
    "7. Convert the received tokens to your desired tokens.\n",
    "8. Repeat from step 2 (if necessary) with fresh tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "(This is probably not right - it depends on a polling loop. We'll probably have a websocket connection for prices and accounts. But then again it may apply on a price change.)\n"
