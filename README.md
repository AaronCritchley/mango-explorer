## Introduction

**I am not yet confident in the figures and calculations. Please don't rely on this code yet!**

There are some notebook pages to explore Mango account structures for your own accounts.

There is also a functional liquidator (in the V2 branch) and a functional marketmaker (in the main branch).


## Running the marketmaker

There is a [Marketmaking Quickstart](docs/MarketmakingQuickstart.md) - a walkthrough of setting up and running the marketmaker, from setting up the account, depositing tokens, to running the marketmaker itself.

It can take around 30 minutes to run through.

Requirements:
* A server with docker installed

**Note** This walkthrough is devnet-only so no actual funds are used or at-risk.



## Running the liquidator

There is a [Liquidator Quickstart](docs/LiquidatorQuickstart.md) - a walkthrough of setting up and running the liquidator, from creating the account, 'balancing' the wallet across the different tokens, and running the liquidator itself.

It can take around 30 minutes to run through.

Requirements:
* A server with docker installed
* Some SOL to pay for transactions
* Some USDC to fund the liquidation wallet

**Note** This is only for liquidating Mango V2. There is no Python V3 liquidator for Mango here (yet).
